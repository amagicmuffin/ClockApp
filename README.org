* ayo wth is this
  I made a clock. It could even be a widget, if I put more work in.

* installation
  Idk man its a python file figure it out.
  Made on windows for windows.
  MinuteClock.pyw should honestly be renamed; its the main app.
  waveClock.py has an extendohand.

* future of this project?
  It will Not Suck (preferably). see TODOs in MinuteClock.pyw.
