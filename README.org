* ayo wth is this
  I made a clock. It could even be a widget, if I put more work in.

* installation
  idk man its a python file figure it out.
  made on windows for windows.
  MinuteClock.pyw should honestly be renamed and its the main one.
  waveClock has an extendohand.

* future of this project?
  It will Not Suck (preferably). see TODOs in MinuteClock.pyw.
